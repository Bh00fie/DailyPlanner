## Introduction

Webpage deployed at: https://bh00fie.github.io/Code-Quiz/

In this challenge, I'll be using the concepts I've learned in the last weeks to complete the required activity.
In this project, I'll be creating an quiz that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that I will have to write. The app has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive and I have ensured that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This project consists to create an interactive timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

## Description

This is a particular timed multiple-choice coding quiz, the user will have 75 seconds to answer all questions, if he manages to do so, he final score will be shown and he will have the change to put his name to store the score. If user answer incorrectly, 10 seconds will be taken off the time, and if the timer runs out the game will end. The user's final score is the number of seconds left on the clock when the game ends.

JS file has been commented on to help understand written code if interested in looking into it more in-depth.

The code has been deployed on the following webpage: https://bh00fie.github.io/Code-Quiz/

## Final Results
When you open your code in the browser my resulting quiz should look similar to the following:
